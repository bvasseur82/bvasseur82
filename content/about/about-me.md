I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and am a proud ramblin' wreck from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I received my PhD in psychology and quantitative methods from Vanderbilt University in 2008. Prior to joining RStudio, I was an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, and an Associate Professor at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). At OHSU, I was an NIH-funded Principal Investigator and an Assistant Center Director.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890) focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific [publications](/publication) on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders and have presented my research at over 25 international conferences.

Thank you so much for reading.
