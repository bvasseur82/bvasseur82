bio: I am passionate about the worlds of financial markets and professional sports. Both can be summarised in numbers and explained with analytical methods, but no one can truly predict them. Trying to understand and rationalise what creates financial over vs. underperformance, victory vs. defeat is what drives me.

I am currently a credit analyst at Scope Ratings in Frankfurt (Germany) and my role is to provide accurate, robust and unbiased opinions on the credit quality of various debt issuers. I specialise in structured finance and have expert knowledge on securitisation, structured products and derivatives, used as financing or investment tools.

Prior to joining Scope Ratings, I have worked ca. 11 years at J.P. Morgan in London in a structuring and marketing role focused on large institutional and corporate clients. This position has been a fantastic opportunity to get exposure to various fields of the financial markets and learn from very knowledgeable colleagues from all backgrounds. My main achievements were to create long-lasting relationships of trust and confidence with clients and colleagues. It helped me broaden my skill sets and not only rely on technical or theoretical knowledge.

I believe education and open-mindedness are key elements to a successful career. Throughout the years I have always tried to explore new areas and learn from my colleagues. Currently, I am developing my programming and data science knowledge using R and Python.

Outside work, I enjoy spending time with my family and try to follow sports (especially football, US sports and golf). I like to watch the competition and to read about the advanced metrics and technology that help us better understand the different games. I also play golf in my free time. It is a fantastic mental and technical challenge and it tests your will not to give up.
